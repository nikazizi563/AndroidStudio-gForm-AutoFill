In my hostel, there was a requirement to fill out a Google Form every time a student wished to leave the premises. 
However, the challenge arose from the extensive length of the form, making it inconvenient for manual completion.


To address this issue, I developed an application that automates the process by prefilling all the necessary information. 
With a simple click of the "start" button, the app streamlines and expedites the entire form submission.


The main page of the app, as depicted in Picture 1 below, showcases a convenient feature that automatically pre-fills data based on the user's previously entered information.

The image below illustrates the Google Form filled with the current time and date automatically.
